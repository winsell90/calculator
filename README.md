# calculator
This was a very challenging project. I created a calculator using custom logic in order to avoid using Function() and Eval(). 

I almost certainly went about this in an overly complex manner. This likely could have been figured out in an easier and more efficient way. 

With that said, this was an excellent learning experience that further familiarized myself with how javascript, css and html all work together. 

I used numerous nested functions, logical operators ||, && and !, switch statements and eventListeners.
